TODO:

Run the rectification code on each pair of images in the MST
	Run Leah's code to get T1 and T2 for each pair. Use the camera parameters from 'frames'
	Run buildRectified on each T and each image to get the rectified images
	Save the output of buildRectified (the image and its vertical offset) in whatever format makes the most sense to you. 
		It just needs to be retreivable using the MST pair list.

Pick a nice image pair and save the verbose output from buildRectified. It'll make a nice demo for the paper/presentation

Run findCorrespondences on this nice pair to get the point correspondences from the sliding window
	Then run triangulate to get the point cloud. Use P1 and P2 from Leah's rectification code as the camera matrices
	Plot the point cloud, check that it looks right. Use only the first three point coordinates, since 4 is the projective coordinate and 5-7 are color values
		If you have time, try and find a way to color each point in the plot with the correct color 
	Save this point cloud for the demo

Note: depending on the size of the images, some of this code could take quite a while to run. 

Thanks!
