Get set of pictures and calibrated cameras (DONE)
Create MST, save edge pairs to file (DONE)
Read edge pairs, rectify, find pixel correspondences, save to file (NEED WRAPPER CODE FOR THIS)
Using saved MST and pixel correspondences, generate point correspondences between every pair of edges with a shared node in the MST (UNDONE)
	(A thought on this: instead of traversing the MST recursively, why don't we just do this manually? It's not like there are huge numbers of cameras or anything...)
For every point correspondence set, find the best-fit similarity transformation (UNDONE)
Apply the similarities in sequence to get a single dense point cloud (UNDONE)
	(This could also be done manually rather than recursively)
